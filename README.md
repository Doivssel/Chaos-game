# Chaos game

This is a very small project with very bad codes. I've got the inspiration from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs of Numberphile.
I've tried different configurations of this game by varying the number of initial point, changing the ratio of placement ect. Underneath 
I've shown the results of executing theses codes, if you have time you should execute some as they are animated (for some the update are too quick so it is difficult to see).
