# Chaos game

This is a very small project with very bad codes. I've got the inspiration from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs of Numberphile.
I've tried different configurations of this game by varying the number of initial point, changing the ratio of placement ect. Underneath 
I've shown the results of executing theses codes.
